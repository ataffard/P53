  <h1 id="title"> Conditional Expressions </h1>
  <div id="content">
    <div class="note">Relational expressions evaluate to either true (1) or false (0). <br />
      Be especially careful
not to use a single equals (=), which is used for assigning a value to a variable,
when you really want to test equality (==). </div>
    <pre>x &gt; 0 x &lt; 0 x &gt;= 0 x &lt;= 0 x == 0 x != 0     </pre>
    <div class="note">Relational operators cannot be chained together, so you cannot write -1 &lt; x &lt; +1.
Instead, use the logical operators described below.
<br /><br />Logical operators combine true/false values where anything equal to zero is considered
false and any other numerical value is considered true.
</div>
    <pre>(...) &amp;&amp; (...) /* true if both sides are true */ 
(...) || (...) /* true if at least one side is true */     </pre>
    <div class="note">You can chain together multiple logical operators into a single expression. <br />
      If you mix
&amp;&amp; and ||, remember that &amp;&amp; has higher precedence (&amp;&amp; and || are analogous to * and +)
</div>
    <pre>(...) &amp;&amp; (...) &amp;&amp; (...) 
((...) || (...)) &amp;&amp; (...)      </pre>
    <div class="note">The sub-expressions within a conditional expression are evaluated in a predictable and
well defined order (generally left to right). <br />
This is important in case any expressions
have side effects (for example, you might call a function that updates a log file). <br />
In case
the final result can be deduced without evaluating all sub-expressions, the remaining
sub-expressions are guaranteed not to be evaluated. <br />
This is called "short-circuit evaluation"
and allows you to write code such as the following.
</div>

    <pre>if(x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; sqrt(x) &lt; 1) { /* sqrt(x) will never be called with x &lt; 0 */ }   </pre>
  </div>
